Description
-----------

Class periods will generally be divided into 40 minutes of lecture and 40 minutes of related hands-on computer work using laptops available in the classroom. In the beginning of the semester recitations will provide computer programming background for students without previous programming experience. Later, these recitations will be used for more in-depth virtual experiments and data analysis exercises and for discussion of homework problems.

Assignments

The class includes several homework sets and three quizzes held during the two hour recitation periods. The grade will be based 40% on homework and in-class exercises and 20% on each of the three quizzes. The lowest homework grade will not be counted. There will be no final exam.
